We ensure high-quality instruction by hiring qualified music teachers, providing ongoing training, and performing regular program assessments. We encourage non-music teachers and music teachers to collaborate so that music can reinforce learning and development in all areas. And we help schools embrace music as a core subject by involving all members of the school community. ETM also provides advisory services to organizations and schools around the United States, including advising two independent 501(c)(3) organizations that replicate our model in schools in the Los Angeles and Denver communities.","tagLine":"Promoting and supporting music instruction in disadvantaged schools","websiteURL":"http://www.etmonline.org/"}},

The Biomimicry Institute was founded in 2006 by Janine Benyus and Bryony Schwan to share nature's design lessons with the people who design and make our world. Our goal today is for biomimicry to become a natural part of the design process. We accomplish this by tackling one massive sustainability problem at a time through our Design Challenges platform, mobilizing tens of thousands of practitioners with the support of the Global Biomimicry Network to solve the challenge, and then providing those practitioners with AskNature as a tool to begin the solution process. We anticipate dozens of new biomimetic innovations will result, creating a healthier world for all.","tagLine":"Creating nature-inspired solutions for a healthy planet","websiteURL":"https://biomimicry.org/"}},
